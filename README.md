# Emotion Classification using BERT

This is the project from my class.
I develop a classification model using BERT to classify emotion based on inputted text.

The result is around 70%, and we can say that it is not that good.
What caused that is the data use formal sentence alot, so it is kinda hard to get the real emotion from the sentence.
